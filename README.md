# Toy Robot (Haskell)

Just noodling around with a solution for the Toy Robot exercise (see PROBLEM.md).

* `Robot.String` is a simple, limited command parser using the String type and pattern matching.
* `Robot.Megaparsec` will be a command parser using the Megaparsec parser-combinator library; this is what I'd reach for in a real program.
